# SFU (LiveKit)

We will run a local LiveKit server on this PC for media routing. This folder will hold config and run scripts.

Phase 1 tasks (planned):
- Add LiveKit config file (keys, ports, region).
- Add Docker or native run script.
- Add health check + logs.

Note: TURN settings will be documented here when finalized.
