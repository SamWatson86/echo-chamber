# Documentation Index

This folder is the shared source of truth for contributors and automation agents.

## Start here

- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — system boundaries, major components, and data flow
- [Operations](./OPERATIONS.md) — day-to-day runbook, deploy, logs, incident basics
- [Testing](./TESTING.md) — verification model, CI expectations, regression strategy
- [Release Boundaries](./RELEASE-BOUNDARIES.md) — when EXE/DMG updates are required vs server-only deploys
- [Terminology](./TERMINOLOGY.md) — shared vocabulary for Sam/agents/contributors
- [Workflow](./WORKFLOW.md) — branching and PR flow
- [Backups](./BACKUPS.md) — backup strategy and recovery notes
- [GitHub setup](./GITHUB.md) — repo setup and collaboration basics

## Decision records (ADR)

- [ADR-0001: Deployment & release boundaries](./ADR/0001-deployment-and-release-boundaries.md)

## Maintenance expectations

- Keep docs practical and bias toward examples/checklists.
- If behavior changes, update docs in the same PR.
- Prefer clear terminology over shorthand (see Terminology doc).
