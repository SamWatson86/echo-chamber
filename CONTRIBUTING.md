# Contributing

## Branching
- `main` = production
- `dev` = integration/testing

## How to submit changes
1) Branch from `dev`
2) Make changes
3) Push your branch
4) Open a Pull Request into `dev`

## Code style
- Keep changes small and testable
- Avoid committing secrets (.env is ignored)
- Update docs for any operational change
